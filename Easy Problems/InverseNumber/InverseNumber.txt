You are given a number following certain constraints.
The key constraint is if the number is 5 digits long, it'll contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing any and without repeating any. e.g. 23415 is a 5 digit long number containing all digits from 1 to 5 without missing and repeating any digit from 1 to 5.Take a look at few other valid numbers - 624135, 81456273, etc. Here are a few invalid numbers - 139, 7421357, etc.
The inverse of a number is defined as the number created by interchanging the face value and index of digits of the number. e.g. for 426135 (reading from right to left, 5 is in place 1, 3 is in place 2, 1 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 2 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6), the inverse will be 416253 (reading from right to left, 3 is in place 1, 5 is in place 2,2 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 1 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6) More examples - the inverse of 2134 is 1243 and inverse of 24153 is 24153
Take as input number "n", assume that the number will follow constraints.
Print its inverse.
